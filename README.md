Odbluzgiwator (automatic cenzorship for Polish language).
Requirements:
- OpenFST (v. 1.6.7)
- Thrax (v. 1.2.5)
- Linux

Usage:
To build grammar just write in grammar directory just "make". It will create necessary .far files.
To test grammar use run.sh script, for example:
- ./run.sh < your_file
- ./run.sh (here you'll be able to put your own string!)

In test directory are put some tests.

Have fun.
